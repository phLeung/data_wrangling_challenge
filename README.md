Data-Wrangling-Challenge

Python script gets daily, monthly, and weekly data from  https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdD.htm .
I extracted the data from the excel files using pandas.
I could've extracted the necessary data via web scraping(beautifulsoup4,requests,etc),
but I found it less complex to build and implement the script via pandas only.

Use Python 3.7 or greater to run this script.
Install all requirements:
pip3 -r install requirements.txt

To run this script:
python3 data_wrangler_script.py
